## What is ERC-7484?

ERC-7484 standardises the interface and functionality of Module Registries, allowing modular smart accounts to verify the security of modules using a Registry Adapter. It also provides a reference implementation of a Singleton Module Registry.

## Why ERC-7484?

ERC-7579 aims to standardise the modular implementation of smart accounts, allowing any developer to build modules for these modular accounts (hereafter Smart Accounts). However, adding third-party modules into Smart Accounts unchecked opens up a wide range of attack vectors. Users need to be able to trust that the modules they are using are secure and will not compromise their accounts and funds.

## The standard

One solution to this security issue is to create a Module Registry that stores security attestations on Modules and allows Smart Accounts to query these attestations before using a module. This standard aims to achieve two things:

1. Standardise the interface and required functionality of Module Registries.
2. Standardise the functionality of Adapters that allow Smart Accounts to query Module Registries.
